## What is it?
The Marlin Project is a collection of personal projects I've created throughout the years. The goal is to continually add new projects to this page as I continue to innovate. Feel free to drop
me a suggestion if you want me to bring your idea to life.

## What does the Marlin Project contain?
A variety of applications.
### Coderpad
The coderpad is an experimental project that allows individuals to write and run snippets of code.
The application currently only supports Python. An interactive version of the coderpad is in
development and will be released under the name _Code with Me_.
### Pastebin
Coming soon!
